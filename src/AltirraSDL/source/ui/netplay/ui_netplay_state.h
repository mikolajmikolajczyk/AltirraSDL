//	AltirraSDL - Online Play UI state (shared across desktop + gaming mode)
//
//	Phase 11 of the netplay plan.  Both the Desktop menu-bar flow and
//	the Gaming-Mode full-screen flow drive the same Netplay session,
//	so the UI state lives in a singleton here and both modes read/
//	write it.  That lets a user switch between modes mid-session
//	without losing their place (e.g. flip to Desktop to configure
//	audio, then back to Gaming Mode to keep playing).
//
//	Content:
//	  - Screen enum + active-screen stack (per mode)
//	  - Persistent preferences (nickname, accept mode, notif toggles)
//	  - Ephemeral session state (selected lobby row, last-error text)
//	  - Lobby browser cache (merged list from all configured lobbies)
//	  - Advisory host-a-game flow state (chosen cart, entry code)
//
//	Persistent fields are saved to the registry under "Netplay".  The
//	transient fields are cleared on Shutdown() so a re-launch doesn't
//	inherit leftover dialog state.
