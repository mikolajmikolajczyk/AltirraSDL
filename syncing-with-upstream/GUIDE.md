# AltirraSDL Upstream Sync — Operator Guide

This guide is the long-form, step-by-step companion to `README.md`. It is
intentionally version-agnostic: nothing here hard-codes "test8" or
"test9". Use it for the current `test8 → test9` transition, and for any
future Altirra release (minor, major, or prerelease).

## Mental model

AltirraSDL is **not** a rewrite — it is a fork that replaces the Win32
frontend with SDL3 + Dear ImGui. The emulation core, the peripheral
device code, the debugger backend, the disk/tape/cartridge I/O and the
kernel ROMs all come straight from upstream Altirra. To stay honest to
"all the hard work is Avery Lee's" (see `README.md`), we must keep that
upstream delta as small as possible and re-apply upstream fixes promptly.

Upstream is distributed as zipped source snapshots, not as a git
repository, so syncing is a structured diff-and-merge operation rather
than a git rebase. The process below makes that operation mechanical,
auditable, and safe to redo.

### Sync direction: one-way, upstream → fork

The upstream author does not accept patches from this fork. Every
artefact this tooling produces — the diff listings, the per-file
`.upstream.diff` / `.fork.diff` / `.full.diff` files, the classification
report — exists solely to guide changes **into** the fork. The tooling
never writes into the OLD or NEW snapshot directories (they are
treated as read-only references), and there is no "send patches back
upstream" path to design for. If a future sync ever needs such a path,
it is a separate project; do not retrofit it into these scripts.

## The three inputs

Every sync has three directories:

| Alias | Role                         | Example path                          |
|-------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| OLD   | Last upstream release already synced into the fork | `Altirra-4.50-test13-src` |
| NEW   | Upstream release we're moving to                    | `Altirra-4.50-test14-src` |
| FORK  | This repo's current working tree                    | `AltirraSDL`              |

Two assumptions the tooling relies on:

1. **OLD matches the upstream snapshot we previously synced with.**
   Concretely, `diff -r OLD/src FORK/src` should only show our own
   deliberate modifications (and the files we added under
   `src/AltirraSDL/`, `tests/`, etc.).
2. **NEW is an unpacked, untouched copy of the upstream zip.** Do not
   edit NEW before running the tooling.

Both OLD and NEW must be source snapshots with a non-empty `src/` tree.
The binary distribution package is not sufficient even if it has the same
version label; it lacks the source baseline required for the three-way diff.
The helper tools, including the changelog extractor, reject missing or empty
configured sync trees before producing output.

If assumption (1) breaks (e.g. the last sync was messy), run the tools
anyway — they will surface the discrepancies so you can clean them up.

## The four change classes

Every file the sync tool emits ends up in exactly one of these buckets:

| Bucket         | Definition (per file)              | Typical action                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **trivial**    | OLD≠NEW, OLD=FORK                  | Straight copy `NEW→FORK`                         |
| **three-way**  | OLD≠NEW, OLD≠FORK                  | Manual/LLM 3-way merge                           |
| **fork-only**  | OLD=NEW, OLD≠FORK                  | Leave fork as-is (upstream untouched)            |
| **unchanged**  | OLD=NEW, OLD=FORK                  | Ignore                                            |

Files in `src/AltirraSDL/`, `cmake/`, `syncing-with-upstream/`, the
top-level `CMakeLists.txt`, `BUILD.md`, `README.md` and similar
"fork-only" paths are expected to be in the **fork-only** bucket and the
tooling filters them out of the upstream diff entirely.

## Module classification

For the three-way files, we further classify by Altirra module to drive
merge priority. This drives `reports/.../07_classified.md` and mirrors
the architecture section of `CLAUDE.md`.

| Class            | Examples                                                  | Sync effort                                    |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| core-emulation   | `src/Altirra/source/{antic,gtia,pokey,cpu,simulator}.cpp`  | Always port — platform-agnostic                |
| core-lib         | `src/ATCore/**`, `src/ATEmulation/**`, `src/ATIO/**`, `src/h/at/**`, `src/h/vd2/system/**`, `src/Kasumi/**`, `src/system/**` | Always port       |
| kernel-rom       | `src/Kernel/**`                                            | Always port (rebuild ROM afterwards)           |
| cmd              | `src/Altirra/source/cmd*.cpp`                              | Reflect user-visible behaviour in ImGui menus  |
| ui-win32         | `src/Altirra/source/ui*.cpp`, `src/ATNativeUI/**`, `src/VDDisplay/**`, `src/Dita/**` | Translate to ImGui only if user-facing |
| win-only         | `src/Altirra/source/*_win32.cpp`, Direct3D, XAudio, Winsock, `src/Riza/**`, `src/Tessa/**`, `src/ATAppBase/**` | Skip — SDL build doesn't compile them |
| build-meta       | `.vcxproj`, `.filters`, `Altirra.rc`, `resource.h`         | Informational; SDL build uses its own CMake    |
| docs             | `changes.txt`, `romset.html`                               | Copy verbatim                                   |
| autogen          | `src/Altirra/autogen/**`                                   | Copy verbatim                                   |
| tests            | `src/ATTest/**`                                            | Port if test target is wired up                 |

## End-to-end procedure

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (for the classification scripts)
- `diff`, `git`, `bash` (standard POSIX)
- A clean or committed working tree — you want to be able to `git diff`
  the sync as one logical unit afterwards.

### 2. Commit or stash current work

Start the sync on a dedicated branch:

```bash
git checkout -b sync/altirra-<new-version>
git status   # must be clean
```

### 3. Verify the OLD snapshot matches what we previously synced

```bash
diff -rq <OLD>/src <FORK>/src \
    | grep -v '^Only in <FORK>' \
    | grep -v 'AltirraSDL' \
    | head
```

You should see only the fork's own edits to shared files (e.g. the
couple of `#ifdef`-style portability tweaks in core files). If anything
unexpected shows up, investigate *before* running the sync — don't let
the tool paper over prior drift.

### 4. Generate the reports

```bash
cd AltirraSDL/syncing-with-upstream

./tools/sync_diff.sh \
    --old  ../../Altirra-4.50-<OLD_VERSION>-src \
    --new  ../../Altirra-4.50-<NEW_VERSION>-src \
    --fork ..
```

This writes `reports/<OLD>__to__<NEW>/` with:

- `SUMMARY.md` — start here
- `00_changelog.txt` — upstream's own change log delta
- `01_upstream_changed.txt` — every file where OLD≠NEW
- `02_fork_changed.txt` — every file where OLD≠FORK
- `03_three_way.txt` — files in both sets (merge required)
- `04_trivial_copy.txt` — safe to copy NEW→FORK
- `05_added_in_new.txt` — new files upstream added
- `06_removed_in_new.txt` — files upstream deleted
- `07_classified.md` — three-way files grouped by module
- `REPORT_INPUTS.txt` — absolute OLD / NEW / FORK paths and sync trees used
- `diffs/<path>.upstream.diff` — OLD vs NEW (the patch upstream authored)
- `diffs/<path>.fork.diff` — OLD vs FORK (the fork's local edits)
- `diffs/<path>.full.diff` — FORK vs NEW (combined, for cross-checking)

If `SUMMARY.md` warns that the report is invalid, or if the report directory
contains `INVALID_REPORT_DO_NOT_USE.md`, stop immediately. Replace the bad
snapshot, regenerate the report, and do not run apply/classification helpers
against the invalid output.
The helper scripts also enforce this: `apply_trivial.py` validates NEW and
FORK source trees before copying, and `classify_changes.py` refuses malformed
or invalid report directories before rewriting `07_classified.md`. When
`REPORT_INPUTS.txt` is present, the helpers use it to locate and validate the
recorded snapshot roots and sync trees instead of relying only on
directory-layout guesses. Older reports without metadata fall back to the
default `src` tree. Metadata OLD/NEW paths must also match the
`<OLD>__to__<NEW>` report directory labels. For `apply_trivial.py`, explicit
`--new` and `--fork` arguments override metadata and are then validated.

### 5. Skim the changelog first

```bash
less reports/<OLD>__to__<NEW>/00_changelog.txt
```

Upstream's `changes.txt` is the most concise description of what
actually shipped. Bullet points starting with `Display:`, `GTIA:`, `UI:`
often correspond 1:1 to files in the report.

### 6. Apply the trivial copies

```bash
./tools/apply_trivial.py reports/<OLD>__to__<NEW>
# then, if you want to also bring over files that are *new* in NEW
# (nothing in the fork for them to conflict with):
./tools/apply_trivial.py reports/<OLD>__to__<NEW> --include-added
```

By default only `04_trivial_copy.txt` is applied — those are files
upstream modified and the fork left untouched. Adding
`--include-added` additionally copies files listed in
`05_added_in_new.txt`. Directory structure is preserved. The script
refuses to touch anything the fork has edited (`02_fork_changed.txt`)
or any three-way file, so running it is safe by construction.

Commit this step on its own. Stage explicitly rather than using
`git add -A` to avoid accidentally capturing untracked local state
(build artefacts, secrets, etc.):

```bash
git add src/
git commit -m "sync(upstream): copy trivial-change files from <NEW_VERSION>"
```

### 7. Hand off the three-way merges

Open `reports/<OLD>__to__<NEW>/07_classified.md` and resolve each file.
For a heavy sync, drive it with an LLM agent using `prompts/PROMPT.md`:

```bash
# Paste this into a fresh Claude/Codex/… session:
cat prompts/PROMPT.md

# Then give the agent the path to the report:
echo "Report path: syncing-with-upstream/reports/<OLD>__to__<NEW>/"
```

The prompt instructs the agent to:

1. Read the classified report.
2. Produce a written plan for approval.
3. Only after approval, start applying changes module-by-module,
   preserving the fork's SDL-specific modifications and reflecting
   user-visible changes in the Dear ImGui frontend.

### 8. UI reflection pass

Changes the agent spots in `src/Altirra/source/cmd*.cpp` and
`src/Altirra/source/ui*.cpp` that alter *user-visible* Windows
behaviour (new menu items, dialog fields, hotkeys, etc.) must be
mirrored in the SDL ImGui frontend under `src/AltirraSDL/source/ui/`.

Rule of thumb from `CLAUDE.md`:

> The SDL3 Dear ImGui UI must replicate Windows Altirra's menus and
> dialogs faithfully — same options, same layout, same location.

The Gaming Mode frontend (`src/AltirraSDL/source/ui/mobile/`) does
**not** need every new setting — only those that are relevant to quick
gameplay (e.g. "toggle warp speed") get propagated there.

### 9. Rebuild & smoke-test

```bash
cd AltirraSDL
./build.sh       # or manual CMake invocation
./build/src/AltirraSDL/AltirraSDL   # golden-path launch test
```

If you bumped `src/Kernel/source/Shared/version.inc`, force-rebuild the
kernel ROM (MADS-based build; see `CLAUDE.md`).

### 10. Record what happened

Append a one-line summary to `syncing-with-upstream/HISTORY.md`
(create on first sync):

```
2026-04-15  4.50-test8 → 4.50-test9  123 files changed, 4 new, 0 removed
```

Commit the sync branch, open a PR, and remove the old snapshot folder
from the repo root once the PR is merged and the new snapshot becomes
the next "OLD".

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                | Likely cause / fix |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `02_fork_changed.txt` lists files you don't recognise as fork edits | Prior sync left drift behind. Inspect `diff OLD/<file> FORK/<file>` for each, decide whether to accept, revert, or re-sync manually before merging the current pair |
| `apply_trivial.py` prints `skip (conflicts with fork changes): …` | The path appears in `02_fork_changed.txt` or `03_three_way.txt`. That is correct behaviour — the file needs a three-way merge, not a copy |
| Kernel ROM builds differ byte-for-byte after sync | Expected if `version.inc` changed — commit the new autogen output |
| ImGui UI is missing a new menu item after sync | The agent stopped at the C++ side; re-run the UI reflection pass with `menu_default.txt` as the ground truth |
| Compiler error in `src/AltirraSDL/…` after sync | A header signature in core code changed — inspect `03_three_way.txt` for `src/h/at/**` entries, patch the SDL-side call site |
| `apply_trivial.py`: `cannot infer NEW label from report dir name` | The report dir isn't under the expected `<FORK>/syncing-with-upstream/reports/<OLD>__to__<NEW>/` layout. Pass `--new` and `--fork` explicitly |

## Design notes

**Why not just `diff -r` and merge?**
Because upstream ships 40+ files per release whose changes are
Win32-native and must be *ignored* by the SDL build, while another 40+
files are core-agnostic and must be *copied verbatim*. A raw diff
drowns the real merge work (~10–20 files per release) in noise.

**Why a Python classifier?**
Bash globs can't easily express "`src/Altirra/source/cmd*.cpp` is a
cmd, but `src/Altirra/source/cmdcart.cpp` ships gaming-mode-relevant
bits too". The classifier is a single file (`tools/lib/filemap.py`);
extend it whenever a new module appears.

**Why keep the reports under `reports/` instead of inline in the PR?**
They are reproducible from inputs and would otherwise bloat reviews.
Add `syncing-with-upstream/reports/` to `.gitignore` (the reports are
recreated on demand).
